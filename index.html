  <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
  <p>JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web. Programming makes computers do what you want them to do. JavaScript is easy to learn.</p>
  <h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn: </p>
  <ul>1. HTML to define the content of web pages</ul>
  <ul>2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages</ul>
  <ul>3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages</ul>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p><i>JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design. JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997. ECMA-262 is the official name. ECMAScript 6 (released in June 2015) is the latest official version of JavaScript.</i></p>
  <h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>

  <p><b>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is completed when "something" calls it. A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses. Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, or anything you want it to be (same rules as variables). The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas. But the every line has to be ended with a semicolon. A semicolon is located next to the letter "L" on the keyboard. The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}. Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition. Function arguments are the real values received by the function when it is invoked. Inside the function, the arguments behave as local variables. The code inside the function will follow commands when "something" calls the function: <ul>When an something happens (when a user clicks a button)</ul> <ul>When it is called from JavaScript code</ul> <ul>Or automatically (self invoked)</ul> When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop performing its assigned task. If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will return to execute the code after the invoking statement. Functions often compute a return value. The return value is returned back to the caller. You can define the code once, and use it many times more. But you'll have to repeat the process again. You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results. Functions can be used as variable values in formulas, assignments, and calculations.
